                           Cryptography Lab 2
                         Making and Breaking RSA
                         =======================

Quick guide
-----------

To build the project you need the GMP library. (Work on university computer)
To compile :
   make

To lauch
   ./rsa <options>
   ./rsa -h : print help (if any...)
	./rsa -t : lauch some test
	./rsa -a <lab file> : break the cypher in the file with k = 30
